Pari is an artist-run space where people and communities come together to talk, think, learn and do. Art and artists are at the core of Pari’s activities: we believe that artists play a vital role in processing and reflecting the important issues of our time. Reflecting the social, the political and the deeply personal, our program draws out ideas that are particular to our location in Western Sydney on unceded Darug land, and that resonate well beyond the local.

We will facilitate the space, but what Pari is will be defined by the people who show here, the people who come and look and listen, the conversations that happen, the things that get said and thought and reconsidered.

Pari pays artist fees for every exhibition and public program, with support from the NSW Government through Create NSW.
