*Pollen* is used for transferring DNA; it carries the memory of its previous form. In the past, there was a predictability to the seasons but as the world shifts, unexpected forms develop in response. In this exhibition, the artists speculate on personal and cultural histories, from local sonic subcultures to temporary infrastructure to global drift. *Pollen* is an exercise in the collective imagining of alternate worlds that could germinate from this current time and place.
