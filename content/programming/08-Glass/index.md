Autonomous, reflective and playful, *Glass* is a voyeuristic dive into the ways in which we look at ourselves and others. If the ego is a constructed self, then *Glass* is the vulnerable space of seeing the self and being seen. In this exhibition, the power dynamics of the gaze are interrogated to create a space for reclamation and self-documentation.
