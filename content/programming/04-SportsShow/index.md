Coming in to bat next is *Sports Show* 🏆  Connecting an all-star lineup of seasoned players and rookies, Pari presents live commentary of the on-and-off field behaviour of sport – the highs and lows, wins and losses.

We’ve smashed our salary cap with this one with support from City of Parramatta.

The game of the season that’s not to be missed. Just another day in #parradise 🏈


In lieu of a regular opening, we will be meeting in Parramatta Park between 2-4pm on Sunday 13th September, where we can keep a safe distance and hopefully get some sun (it'll be postponed if it rains). We will walk groups of up to 15 people at a time down to Pari and back to check out the show. At the Park, we'll be just behind the rose garden near Pitt St. BYO picnic blankets, people from your household that you can hang close with, masks, snacks n drinks. In order to minimise risk and interactions, we won't be catering but we'll have masks and sanitiser on hand. You’ll need to wear a mask to enter the gallery.

This project has been supported by the City of Parramatta Creative Project Leveraging Fund.
