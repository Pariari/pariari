synopsis: 'Not long ago, it seemed like mixed businesses were on almost every street corner in Parra. They’re still here, mostly in the surrounding suburbs: next to roundabouts, between apartment blocks and houses mid-renovation. Little family-run businesses stocking contradictory products side-by-side on rickety shelves. Some tins host dust and dead bugs; other shelves are perpetually empty, signalling what’s important to the 100 people in the immediate area.'

Not long ago, it seemed like mixed businesses were on almost every street corner in Parra. They’re still here, mostly in the surrounding suburbs: next to roundabouts, between apartment blocks and houses mid-renovation. Little family-run businesses stocking contradictory products side-by-side on rickety shelves. Some tins host dust and dead bugs; other shelves are perpetually empty, signalling what’s important to the 100 people in the immediate area.

Pari invokes the mixed business as a mode of operation, for multiplicity and exchange: a cornerstore(stone) for community and convenience.
