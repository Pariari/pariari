  This will be an interactive session where you will learn more about Gudskulâ€™s origins and working methodologies, have the chance to ask questions, and take part in Speculative Collective, Gudskulâ€™s latest iteration of a knowledge-sharing and mapping module.

  Speculative Collective was conceived as a tool to explore forms of collectivising through direct practice, forming a kind of know-how. Compressed both spatially and temporally, the project extends from ongoing work within the context of Jakarta. In a loosely defined process, Gudskul invites strangers to meet and share what they consider to be â€˜knowledgeâ€™ by playing the roles of both teacher and student in a quick reciprocal exchange. This newly formed pair must then couple with another pair, forming a temporary collective. Gudskul has designed a â€˜toolâ€™ to enable participants to record this process for themselves and carry it on past these random yet choreographed meetings.

  This workshop is open to all Australian-based participants. You donâ€™t have to be an artist to participate. If youâ€™re part of a collective yourself â€” thatâ€™s great! Itâ€™s best if only one person from the group participates as this workshop is about connecting people with different kinds of knowledge who donâ€™t already know each other.

  Gudskul: Contemporary Art Collective and Ecosystem Studies (or, for short, Gudskul, which is pronounced like â€˜good schoolâ€™ in English) is a public learning space established by three Jakarta-based art collectives: Grafis Huru Hara, ruangrupa and Serrum. Since the early 2000s, all three have actively immersed themselves into the contemporary art realm by practising a collective and collaborative mode of working. They collectively formed Gudang Sarinah Ekosistem in 2015 to practise an expanded understanding of collective values such as equality, sharing, solidarity, friendship and togetherness. The collective transformed into Gudskul in 2018.

  Weâ€™re The White Pube, two critics based in the UK (London & Liverpool). We write about exhibitions, institutions, video games, food, Love Island & sometimes we make memes - all between the holy trinity of our website [thewhitepube.com](https://www.thewhitepube.co.uk/), and across Instagram and Twitter as @thewhitepube. We started the website as a joke back in 2015 because we did not enjoy the way exhibitions were written about and noticed only a select few people ever got to do that writing, but now this is our real life job! Weâ€™ve learned a lot over the past 4 and a half years: on starting your own Thing, running a website, on writing itself, building a readership, finding subjects to write about, how the art world functions, how to run a reader-supported website, and finding other freelance work as a writer. We have seen criticism change things, and we have seen embodied criticism give creators a sense of how it feels to encounter their work.

  Our workshop for P2P will be one session in three parts: the first third of the workshop will be a run down on The White Pubeâ€™s origin story, our politics and some logistics; the second will look over texts from us and from Australian writers too; and then the workshop will end with a discussion on starting things up yourself or re-working something that exists already in case there is something specific you want to bring to the table. We also just want to have a chat about how you see the writing scene in Australia - what is going on there, what are your main gripes, and is criticism ever noticeably instrumental in how artists and institutions operate? We want this workshop to encourage people to speak/write/instagram/tweet their thoughts and feelings, which is something we feel comfortable doing but it is an empowerment we have had to learn; and it is something thatâ€™s only been possible because we work as a collaboration. Maybe this workshop will offer the same feeling of having someone in your corner too.

  There are a limited amount of spaces for participants because we want to make sure that, if they want to, everyone has a chance to speak. If you would like to be involved, please click on the button below. You will be taken to a form to fill out our details, why you want to be a part of this session and links to your texts online or PDFs uploaded to Dropbox/Google Drive so we can get familiar with what people are writing about.

  We will then confirm participants and send out a short reading list of texts we would like to discuss in the workshop.

  We look forward to meeting with you.
